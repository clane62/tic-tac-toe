## About

In this project, I'll be creating a functional two player game of tic tac toe. 

## Planning and Problem Solving

Keywords/Deliverables: 
- Game will need to switch between players
- Winning (matching three in a row) 
- Visually display the winner. 
- Formatted in html, css, javascript 
- JavaScript/DOM manipulation 
- Hosted online 
- Semantic best practice displayed for HTML/CSS 

Problems to solve:
- 9 squares with event listeners
- 8 combinations of winner
- Is that 8 sets of if statements(?)
- Method to draw? 9 if statements then. (ie no match == draw)
- function to calculate/display the winner

Plan:
- build HTML
- build base CSS (square grid)
- create JS file
- link CSS and JS to HTML
- using the logic of recent 'make it green' project, create an event listener for each square and visually changing click.
- build if statements for the winning combinations (eg ABC, ADG, AEI, CEG, CFI, DEF, BEH, GHI).
- Investigate/ test toggle feature for the two player deliverable.
- seperate into functions, streamlining/minimising if possible. 
- take the trio of highlighted clicks and return winner
- Assess functionality and reasses code if necessary.

## Cool Tech
- Within this project i've used JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
- animations
- Everything is a pretty colour :) 

## Bugs to fix
- Initially I had a lot of issues with the 'draw feature'. Even after I got it working, it continued to show up after the first click of the first game. Eventually I worked out that the conditionals were not 100% right and I've fixed this. 
- Whilst not a bug, I really would have preferred a smoother transition on the background image once it moves too high. In future I might look at having the background image be stagnant and have the clouds (as a seperate image moving) to avoid this. 

## Lessons learnt
- start small, focus on the necessary things to fix. 
- don't overcomplicate things. 
- whilst planning, think about how all the features will work together. 
- commit often!

## future features
- It would also be great to add sounds. 
- it would also be great to have a player choose a colour to play as.
